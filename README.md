react-router-demo
======
this is a simple demo for myself to learn react-router V4.0, and here are so much experience I had summed up.

Start
-----

1 . download the repo 

`git clone https://github.com/zhongdeming428/react-router-demo.git`

2 . change the directory to 'react-router-demo'

`cd react-router-demo`

3 . install all the dependencies

`npm install`

4 . you can start a local server

`npm start`

Tips
-----
some useful repos :

* [showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) ---> turns the markdown file to html file easily
* [fdaciuk/ajax](https://github.com/fdaciuk/ajax) --- pure ajax module, easy to use
